Week 1 

This week I used Al to help me remember how to use the .strip() function. 
I did not use AI to complete the work for me, I instead use it to understand 
its function in example problems. I like how it broke down it's syntax and
how to remove specific characters.

#Week 3 AI Journal

This week I used AI to help refresh my memory when it comes to using elif. It helped me understand that it is used in a conditional statement
after a if statement. I remember learning this in INST126 but could not recall how to use it. It gave me a few examples which was great.
